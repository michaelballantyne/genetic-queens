N-Queens
=

Implementation of several different algorithms to produce solutions to the n-queens problem. backtracking.py take a single arugment of board size and provides a very simple backtracking implementation that produces a single solution.

geneticqueens.py provides its own usage information when run. It provides a genetic algorithms implementation and supports several problem representations and selection algorithms.

Public domain.
